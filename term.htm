Terminal Fundamentals!

UNIX: An Operating System For Old People

Where am I?! Who am I?! What's going on?

When you first open up the terminal, you might have no idea what's going on. It's okay! We'll get through this.

Typically, you'll be dropped into your home directory, usually referred to as ~. Let's see where we are!

MOVING COMMANDS:

pwd (print working directory) - pwd will tell you what directory you're in.

ls - ls is your best friend. It shows what is in a directory. Without any arguments, ls will display what's in the current directory.

cd - changes directories!

FILE AND DIRECTORY STUFF:

touch - makes an empty file!

cp - copies a file!

mv - moves a file!

rm - removes a file!

mkdir - makes a directory!

rmdir - removes a directory!

TEXT STUFF:

cat - dumps out the contents of a file

less - dumps out the contents of a file... a little bit at a time.

vi - nerd stuff
